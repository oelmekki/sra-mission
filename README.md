Shadowrun Anarchy Generator allows to automatize generating contract briefs
for use in Shadowrun Anarchy, through Controlled Anarchy.


## What

If you don't know Controlled Anarchy, [go give it a read](https://www.surprisethreat.com/single-post/controlled-anarchy), because you won't understand what this is about otherwise. :) But to sum it up: this
is about generating a vague mission brief that players playing without a
dedicated game master can get inspired by to develop their shared narration
while playing. It does not generate detailed mission, just enough to
trigger imagination. 

This webapp allows to automatize the part of Controlled Anarchy which is
about generating a mission brief and the part about generating NPCs, so
that you can start playing fast. The other parts (like the story beat
generation) are rare enough / fast enough to not need any automated
computation.


## Where

The app can be run through github pages here.


## What about my language?

English and French are the only two languages I speak, but if you're in
another big community of Shadowrun (looking at you, Germany ;) ) and want
to translate it, you can fork this repos, copy `js/translations/en.js`,
translate the text in quotes and send me a pull request.


## Credits

The real credit for designing this should go to people at [Surprise Threat!](https://www.surprisethreat.com/),
I just translated their system into code.

And thanks [Catalyst Game Labs](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/) for Shadowrun Anarchy, it's awesome.
